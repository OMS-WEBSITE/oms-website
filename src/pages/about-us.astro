        Founder’s Story
      </h2>
      <p>
        Pranay Wadyalkar began his career in metallurgy and non-destructive
        testing, spending decades inside the laboratories that keep industries
        safe. Through those years, he saw the same struggle repeat - skilled
        engineers forced to manage audits, paperwork, and manual reporting
        instead of focusing on real quality work.
      </p>
      <p>
        That real-world challenge led to OMS Software - practical, compliant,
        and built by people who’ve lived the audit process. Pranay’s vision was
        simple: if machines can work for you, let them. OMS automates the
        workflows, approvals, and traceability that once consumed entire teams,
        allowing laboratories to focus on science, not spreadsheets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, OMS stands as a bridge between technical expertise and digital
        efficiency - empowering labs to learn, teach, and delegate with
        confidence while remaining fully compliant with ISO/IEC 17025, 17020,
        and 9001 standards.

        CEO’s Message
      </h2>
      <p>
        At OMS Software, our mission is to empower laboratories and inspection
        agencies to achieve and maintain the highest standards of quality and
        compliance. We’re building a unified digital platform that simplifies
        the everyday challenges of managing systems aligned with ISO/IEC 17025,
        ISO/IEC 17020, and ISO 9001 - the very frameworks that define
        competence, impartiality, and consistency in the TIC industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        These standards demand more than documentation; they demand
        traceability, transparency, and accountability. OMS turns those
        principles into living workflows - automating processes, maintaining
        10-year data integrity, and ensuring that every action, record, and
        report remains fully audit-ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our vision is to make compliance effortless and accuracy continuous -
        helping accredited organisations focus on testing, inspection, and
        calibration, while the system quietly manages the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built by practitioners, refined through experience, and trusted by
        laboratories across India and Australia, OMS Software is shaping the
        digital future of conformity assessment.

        CDO’s Message
      </h2>
      <p>
        At OMS Software, our goal is to make technology work quietly behind the
        scenes - so laboratories can focus on precision, not process. As Chief
        Development Officer, I lead our engineering vision to build a platform
        that reflects the discipline of ISO/IEC 17025, ISO/IEC 17020, and ISO
        9001, yet feels effortless to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call this approach compliance by design. Every workflow, audit log,
        and report format is developed to meet accreditation requirements from
        day one - not as an afterthought. Each release strengthens traceability,
        data integrity, and cross-module automation, ensuring that OMS grows
        with every lab it serves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our development team blends domain knowledge from real-world testing and
        calibration labs with modern software engineering. The result is a
        secure, stable, and continually evolving system that helps organisations
        stay audit-ready, efficient, and future-proof.
