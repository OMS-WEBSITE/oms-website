        Founder‚Äôs Story
      </h2>
      <p>
        Pranay Wadyalkar began his career in metallurgy and non-destructive
        testing, spending decades inside the laboratories that keep industries
        safe. Through those years, he saw the same struggle repeat ‚Äî skilled
        engineers forced to manage audits, paperwork, and manual reporting
        instead of focusing on real quality work.
      </p>
      <p>
        That real-world challenge led to OMS Software ‚Äî practical, compliant,
        and built by people who‚Äôve lived the audit process. Pranay‚Äôs vision was
        simple: if machines can work for you, let them. OMS automates the
        workflows, approvals, and traceability that once consumed entire teams,
        allowing laboratories to focus on science, not spreadsheets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, OMS stands as a bridge between technical expertise and digital
        efficiency ‚Äî empowering labs to learn, teach, and delegate with
        confidence while remaining fully compliant with ISO/IEC 17025, 17020,
        and 9001 standards.

        CEO‚Äôs Message
      </h2>
      <p>
        At OMS Software, our mission is to empower laboratories and inspection
        agencies to achieve and maintain the highest standards of quality and
        compliance. We‚Äôre building a unified digital platform that simplifies
        the everyday challenges of managing systems aligned with ISO/IEC 17025,
        ISO/IEC 17020, and ISO 9001 ‚Äî the very frameworks that define
        competence, impartiality, and consistency in the TIC industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        These standards demand more than documentation; they demand
        traceability, transparency, and accountability. OMS turns those
        principles into living workflows ‚Äî automating processes, maintaining
        10-year data integrity, and ensuring that every action, record, and
        report remains fully audit-ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our vision is to make compliance effortless and accuracy continuous ‚Äî
        helping accredited organisations focus on testing, inspection, and
        calibration, while the system quietly manages the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built by practitioners, refined through experience, and trusted by
        laboratories across India and Australia, OMS Software is shaping the
        digital future of conformity assessment.

      </h2>
      <p>
        At OMS Software, our goal is to make technology work quietly behind the
        scenes ‚Äî so laboratories can focus on precision, not process. As Chief
        Development Officer, I lead our engineering vision to build a platform
        that reflects the discipline of ISO/IEC 17025, ISO/IEC 17020, and ISO
        9001, yet feels effortless to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call this approach compliance by design. Every workflow, audit log,
        and report format is developed to meet accreditation requirements from
        day one ‚Äî not as an afterthought. Each release strengthens traceability,
        data integrity, and cross-module automation, ensuring that OMS grows
        with every lab it serves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our development team blends domain knowledge from real-world testing and
        calibration labs with modern software engineering. The result is a
        secure, stable, and continually evolving system that helps organisations
        stay audit-ready, efficient, and future-proof.
