            Secured Signing of Reports
          </h4>
          <p>
            Unlike other fragmented or individual document signing software
            systems, the OMS Software Platform is a fully integrated system,
            designed to save your company at least $55 per user, per month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within OMS Software, a signature of a signatory is uploaded only
            once and stored securely within the program. No other users from
            your company can view or download or misuse the uploaded signature.
          </p>
          <p>
            When an OMS Software user is approved as a signatory, in a specific
            test method, or inspection procedure or a manufacturing process,
            only then will the OMS platform prompt a user for the signature
            feature.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-orange-600 mt-6">
            With a simple single click, a document can be viewed as a PDF, then
            digitally signed and then emailed to the pre-loaded email ID..

          <img
            src="/images/Solutions-Report-sign.jpg"
            alt="Solutions-Report-sign"

          />
          <p>
            This simple process eliminates the entire process of downloading
            documents and then printing, picking from the printer and then
            manually signing and then scanning, storing on your server and then
            emailing to the concerned party. It also eliminates unsatisfactory
            security process wherein some organisations import their signatures
            in a word document and then convert that document into a PDF.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the OMS platform is designed to be fully traceable and auditable
            software, any changes by your staff to the status of a report such
            as signing or emailing is automatically registered. This provides
            additional productivity suite to your organisation to review when
            and who signed or emailed reports or documents, if and when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The integrated, digitalised & fully secured process in the OMS
            platform can save your organisation‚Äôs stationary cost and manual
            document handling cost, resulting in increased productivity.
          </p>
          <p>As an example,</p>
          <p>
            if your company is generating approximately 100 reports per month
            and your company‚Äôs average operating cost is approximately
            $2.50/minute then at a rate of 5minutes per report you would be
            saving approximately $15,000 per annum ($2.50 x 5 x 100 x 12) as a
            minimum cost. This does not include the cost of stationery, printer
            ink and asset depreciation or rental cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the cost saving, you are indirectly contributing to
            the environmental sustainability by elimination of printing; which
            is more significant than cost saving.

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-orange-600 mt-6">
            Signature security on reports
          </h4>
          <p> OMS Software is all about data security and privacy of users.</p>
          <p>
            In most document signing software, signature is either adopted to
            some random cursive font generated your full name or your signature
            is uploaded into their document or their system. This signature is
            then printed on documents which can copied by other parties without
            your consent and pasted in other documents again without your
            consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the OMS platform, we handle signatures differently to ensure
            integrity of the signature is secured and maintained. Firstly, any
            signature printed on a document is digitally watermarked so that the
            copied signature cannot be used in other documents as the document
            number will not match.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-orange-600 mt-6">
            Reports on hold
          </h4>
          <p>
            At times a signatory may find an issue or problem with a report and
            cannot sign off final approval. The OMS platform has a feature that
            enables the signatory to include comments for the tester to receive
            via a pop-up on their login similar to the below.
