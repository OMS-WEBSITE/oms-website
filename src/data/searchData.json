OMS automates monitoring, prevents errors, and avoids penalties due to lapsed certifications.\nThe platform archives expired records, stops reminders automatically after renewal, and prevents deletion of personnel records, saving time and protecting data integrity.\n• Report by Document Type\nThe OMS platform provides detailed reports on all staff certifications, qualifications, skills, and competencies, including attainment date, reminder date, and expiration date.\n• Manage Personnel Records\nStaff records can be managed easily.

OMS ensures up-to-date access to all personnel data.\n\nTimesheets\nFor most businesses, time tracking and invoicing go hand in hand.\nThe OMS platform has made time entry and invoicing with clients extremely simple. Staff can enter their hours worked into the OMS platform using a smartphone, tablet or computer, at a time and place of their choosing.\n• Staff Activities\nTime worked can be broken down into numerous activities such as forklift, coatings, NDT, meetings, just to name a few. The activities list can also be customised to your business requirements.\n• Invoicing\nTime entered can be allocated directly to a client job number, allowing seamless invoicing.\n• Allowances and Leave\nComplying with legislative requirements, staff can factor in their applicable car allowance, meal allowance, living away from home allowance, and leave in the same timesheet.\nThe OMS platform also allows you to easily edit or modify any time that you might have missed or allocated to the incorrect job.\nOnce submitted, timesheets will be available for a manager or supervisor to approve and make changes where required, before submitting to payroll.\nEvery time a user logs into the OMS platform, the platform automatically searches for that user’s timesheet information. If a timesheet has not been entered for the previous working day, the system will automatically exclude the user from performing some tasks until the timesheet is updated. This ensures all times are entered into the database accurately and billed to the client on time.\n\nManage Users\nOMS Software Pty Ltd is all about auditability, traceability, and reproducibility.\nIn addition to the typical user management available in most programmes, your Business can be reassured that the OMS platform can trace any updates or changes made by any or all users.\nThe point of difference in the OMS Platform is the authorised user 'SuperUser' can obtain a list of all staff access levels, permissions and most importantly the audit trail revealing any changes or updates made by a particular user and the date and time the change was made.\n• Automatic Protection from Ex-Employee\nOMS is all about data integrity, traceability, security and protection from unwanted users, threats, or intruders.\nOn many occasions, businesses have experienced internal sabotage due to a disgruntled ex-employee. When an employee is separated from a company, there is a process of revoking all IT access. Occasionally, there is a lag in completing this task, leaving your business vulnerable to such threats.\nTo manage data breaches or any threats from ex-employees, the OMS platform has been designed with augmented intelligence (AI). The OMS Platform will automatically SUSPEND the login for the ex-employee due to the absence of time records for the period specified by your organisation.\nWhen a user is suspended automatically by the OMS, only the authorised user at your Enterprise can grant access (if required) to the suspended employees by accessing the user manager section.\n\nContact List\nThe OMS platform can store important business and staff contact information in a secured online directory, that can only be accessed with a user login.\nThis is the internal directory for your business, storing all branch or location details (address and main phone number) and a list of staff information including:\n• Name\n• Branch\n• Position\n• Qualifications\n• Mobile and phone numbers\n• Email address\n\nActivity Approval\n• Staff Approval Status\nStaff records can be easily managed through the OMS platform. The OMS platform will list the access levels that a particular user has, to a test method or technique.\n• Not Authorised – Can only enter test data for other approved testers. Cannot sign a report\n• Trainee – Can perform testing under supervision of approved testers, enter test data, but cannot sign a report\n• Tester/Inspector/Process – Supervise trainees, perform testing independently, enter test data but cannot sign a report\n• Signatory – Supervise trainees, perform testing independently, enter test data and sign a report\n• Technical Auditor – Supervise trainees, perform testing, inspection processes independently, enter data, sign a report, and conduct technical audits on other staff\n• Authorised Approver – Authority to supervise other staff, perform testing independently, sign reports, conduct technical audits, approve or revoke approval for trainees, testers, signatories, technical auditors\nFrom this section of the platform an authorised approver can edit the test method, view a history of the test method for the selected user or approve or revoke access. For further information on this feature, contact us for an obligation free demonstration.\nSecurity for approved testers: In the OMS platform any user can select another user as the approved tester.

    "description": "Lead Management\nThere are several very good off-the-shelf CRM programs available in the industry. Although they are excellent in their domains, most of them are fragmented and not integrated with the Enterprise operations and management of jobs and accounting.\n\nBusiness relationship management (BRM) module or Lead management (LM) or commonly known as CRM is an integral part of the OMS to manage leads, potential clients and customers. OMS’ BRM module is not only connected to the Fee proposals or quotations module of the OMS but it is also integrated in managing jobs, reports and accounting activities.\n\nMany SMEs either do not have a CRM program or if they have it, it is fragmented and not integrated with their operations and job management programs or accounting packages, or if connected, there is a need for management to visit the CRM to find performance of marketing or business development activities.\n\nOMS is designed to save time for business owners, directors and managers. Hence, instead of a person wasting their time to open the CRM program, then login, then search for the required business performance reports for a date period, OMS emails monthly reports automatically to the nominated staff of the company. This saves time for multiple employees of the company for accessing the same information.\n\nSome businesses either have no process in place to manage or prioritise their leads, or some of the fragmented CRM programs do not have adequate configurable tools to filter or prioritise leads. In the OMS, a user can create ranking by creating a list of parameters and its own weighing criteria. OMS can then use these weighting parameters to calculate highest ranking lead and display to the marketing/business development staff in the order of priority. Without prioritising leads, a company may lose opportunity if not acted in a timely manner.\n\nMost importantly, the BRM / CRM list is secured within the OMS. Except SuperUser login (Generally Directors or their delegates), other users cannot readily download the CRM data and move to another business.\n\nFor further information on this feature, contact us for an obligation free demonstration.",

Job confirmation automatic email: The OMS Software platform is designed to operate in accordance with ISO 17025, ISO 17020, ISO 9001 and similar quality Standards where several quality events are required to be completed effectively. ISO 17025 Cl. 7 specifies that the laboratory shall adequately document and understand work requests and contracts. Laboratories shall select appropriate methods and procedures that meet the customers’ requirements and inform them when any deviation from the work request or a contract occurs. The standard also specifies that any differences between the contract or work request shall be resolved before laboratory activities commence. To comply with the above requirements and as a best industry practice, the OMS platform will automatically email job details to the customer after a job has been created in the OMS platform. Automatic email can be configured at each client contact level and ceased at the job creation level or job revision process. In accordance with ISO 17025 Clause 7.1.4, any differences between the work request / contract shall be resolved before laboratory activities commence. Each contract shall be acceptable to both, the laboratory, and the customer. The automated email provides an opportunity to your customer to review the job details and contact you for any discrepancies. This process achieves the ISO requirements and ensures that your business is operating efficiently. Editing a pre-configured email: OMS Software is designed to eliminate as many manual processes as possible, including having pre-configured emails, however we do understand that some elements of a process need to be customisable to allow for client specific information and communication. When emailing a report to a client, the pre-configured email text in the email body, can be modified before sending the email and report to a client. List of Modules: Currently, there are several test, inspection and process modules available in the OMS. Some of them are Intelligence Augmented Automatic Compliance Evaluator (IAACE) modules which use Standards and material properties to evaluate test results to eliminate human errors in interpreting Standards requirements. These modules have been used by laboratories for years witnessing Million+ hours of production testing on actual data by real people (150+ users). NDT modules – VT, MT, PT, ET, UT, UTT, RT and …. Mechanical testing – Tensile*, Impact* and … Weld mechanical testing – VT, Macro, Bend, fracture, transverse tension*, web-flange tension*, impact*, hardness survey* Inspection modules – VI, PVI and … Pressure testing – Hydrostatic test Survey modules – Rail alignment*, Pipe ovality measurement and … Process modules – Welding supervision and … Chemical testing – O.E.S Spectroscopy* (Beta) and … * IAACE – Intelligence Augmented Automatic Compliance Evaluator modules. Structure of modules: The most common excuses for data losses in the industry are tablet broke down, battery drained, internet lost, user forgot to save, and so on. OMS is designed to ensure almost nothing is lost or at the most previous 3 minutes of data loss, in case of a major outage. All modules for test, inspection or process are divided into 8 sections to eliminate or minimise entire data loss. All sections are designed to reduce data entry (typing) by human data and reduce fatigue on the user. JSA Section – Before any onsite job commencement, a user needs to complete Job safety analysis on their smart phone or tablet or smart glasses in the near future. Section 1 – Displays client information for review before commencing a job. No need to enter anything. Section 2 – Displays job related information. Again, nothing to enter except review of job data. Section 3 – User shall enter instrument information. All items are a simple selection of items from the Asset database available within the OMS. Users need to only key in the first 3 letters of the asset number or asset classification and then select from the list. OMS do not display any non-calibrated assets which ensures that the user do not use invalid instruments. Section 4 – The user needs to enter job specific or technique specific information. Most of the information is selection from reference libraries rather than manual typing. All reference libraries are created by Level 3 or competent authorities which your company can modify to suit your needs. Selection of data from reference libraries minimises data entry errors and standardises terminologies used. Section 5 – User needs to type in relevant information because this section contains description, identification of all items and test data. Most fields can be completed by selection of data from the reference libraries but there is still substantial need for data entry by the user. As the user can be on this section for a long time, OMS saves data automatically after every 3 minutes. Section 6 – Designed to manage all photographs and documents which can be stored in the OMS permanently and the user can decide whether to print on a report. Section 7 – Costing and administration section wherein the user needs to enter job related times and cost. Search Jobs: In this section of the OMS platform, a user can easily search and modify any job that is in the system.
