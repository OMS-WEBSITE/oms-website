    "description": "Invoices:\n- Automatic Bank Feed – Payment Received\nOMS is designed to save every possible minute of labor time in an Enterprise. Instead of manually entering each bank payment transaction, you can automatically view all records on your screen by simply downloading your bank transactions from the prior period and uploading the CSV file in the OMS.\nThen they just have to single click (apply) received payments to appropriate clients in your OMS. Depending on the speed of your accounts receivable staff, this automation can save a minimum of 4 hours per 50 transactions per work-day. At an average Enterprise cost of $2.50/minute, most Enterprises would save approximately $156,000/annum (260 workdays per annum x 4hrs x 60mins x $2.50 per min Enterprise cost).\n\nPayments Received:\nIt is important for any business to be able to apply payments received to the correct customer invoices. The OMS platform makes this step easy with a predefined list of unpaid invoices.\nThe OMS allows the user to search by client and allocate the payment amount or credit amount to any open invoices in the platform.\nThe OMS platform can provide a payment received history to track prior payments for all customers.\nFor further information on this feature, contact us for an obligation free demonstration.\n\nInvoice Search:\nIn this section, a permitted user can search & filter by Paid, Unpaid or both. The point of difference in the OMS platform is that a user from a multi-branch company will be able to search, filter and export a report to Excel, as a combined report for the entire business, or as individual tabs for each of the branches/locations.\n\nSimplified CreditNote:\nIssuing a credit note is already an indirect loss-making process. The OMS platform is equipped with intelligence augmentation (IA) to eliminate most manual labour work and to record important information for traceability and audit purposes. The OMS Platform will record date, time, username, and the reason for the credit note, before allowing the user to create a credit note. When staff are required to issue a full credit note, this can be completed with a single click. The OMS platform can automatically create the entire original invoice in a negative invoice (credit note). Once reviewed and generated, this will automatically be emailed to the accounts contact on file.\n\nUn-Invoiced Jobs:\nThe OMS platform has a fully integrated accounting system; the job and work activities are directly connected with the accounting activities. There is no external accounting or ERP package. OMS ensures that the business does not lose any revenue for any chargeable activity. Every job or activity within the business will be tracked, displayed & emailed to the directors, owners, CFO’s inbox automatically. The OMS platform tracks and maintains a list of un-invoiced jobs or jobs that require additional invoicing for the completion of other activities.\n\nInvoice Summary:\nAn invoice summary is a collection of invoices that your company has created and processed in the OMS platform. It can be used as an overview of your company’s financial operations and can be filtered using the following criteria: Time period, Paid Invoices, Unpaid Invoices, Credit invoices, Client. This summary can be exported to Excel to search or filter information further.\n\nUnallocated Payment:\nThank you for visiting, This is a new and exciting feature in the OMS platform, and we’re busy making this webpage available for you as soon as possible.

This is where the OMS platform can assist. You can customise the OMS platform to automatically email your clients who haven’t paid on time, in several stages, eliminating the need for one of your staff members bearing the brunt of that difficult conversation. For further information on this feature, contact us for an obligation free demonstration.\n\nDebt History:\nAs debt recovery in the OMS platform is automatic, the Debt history report provides an overview of when the system has triggered a reminder email for outstanding payments. This report will provide: Client name, Email, Job number, Invoice number, Date triggered, And the rule number (reminder) that was sent.\n\nReports:\nAutomatic notification of non-invoiced jobs.\nOMS Software is all about increasing productivity by ensuring your business doesn’t lose any revenue for any chargeable activity.

OMS ensures up-to-date access to all personnel data.\n\nTimesheets\nFor most businesses, time tracking and invoicing go hand in hand.\nThe OMS platform has made time entry and invoicing with clients extremely simple. Staff can enter their hours worked into the OMS platform using a smartphone, tablet or computer, at a time and place of their choosing.\n• Staff Activities\nTime worked can be broken down into numerous activities such as forklift, coatings, NDT, meetings, just to name a few. The activities list can also be customised to your business requirements.\n• Invoicing\nTime entered can be allocated directly to a client job number, allowing seamless invoicing.\n• Allowances and Leave\nComplying with legislative requirements, staff can factor in their applicable car allowance, meal allowance, living away from home allowance, and leave in the same timesheet.\nThe OMS platform also allows you to easily edit or modify any time that you might have missed or allocated to the incorrect job.\nOnce submitted, timesheets will be available for a manager or supervisor to approve and make changes where required, before submitting to payroll.\nEvery time a user logs into the OMS platform, the platform automatically searches for that user’s timesheet information. If a timesheet has not been entered for the previous working day, the system will automatically exclude the user from performing some tasks until the timesheet is updated. This ensures all times are entered into the database accurately and billed to the client on time.\n\nManage Users\nOMS Software Pty Ltd is all about auditability, traceability, and reproducibility.\nIn addition to the typical user management available in most programmes, your Business can be reassured that the OMS platform can trace any updates or changes made by any or all users.\nThe point of difference in the OMS Platform is the authorised user 'SuperUser' can obtain a list of all staff access levels, permissions and most importantly the audit trail revealing any changes or updates made by a particular user and the date and time the change was made.\n• Automatic Protection from Ex-Employee\nOMS is all about data integrity, traceability, security and protection from unwanted users, threats, or intruders.\nOn many occasions, businesses have experienced internal sabotage due to a disgruntled ex-employee. When an employee is separated from a company, there is a process of revoking all IT access. Occasionally, there is a lag in completing this task, leaving your business vulnerable to such threats.\nTo manage data breaches or any threats from ex-employees, the OMS platform has been designed with augmented intelligence (AI). The OMS Platform will automatically SUSPEND the login for the ex-employee due to the absence of time records for the period specified by your organisation.\nWhen a user is suspended automatically by the OMS, only the authorised user at your Enterprise can grant access (if required) to the suspended employees by accessing the user manager section.\n\nContact List\nThe OMS platform can store important business and staff contact information in a secured online directory, that can only be accessed with a user login.\nThis is the internal directory for your business, storing all branch or location details (address and main phone number) and a list of staff information including:\n• Name\n• Branch\n• Position\n• Qualifications\n• Mobile and phone numbers\n• Email address\n\nActivity Approval\n• Staff Approval Status\nStaff records can be easily managed through the OMS platform. The OMS platform will list the access levels that a particular user has, to a test method or technique.\n• Not Authorised – Can only enter test data for other approved testers. Cannot sign a report\n• Trainee – Can perform testing under supervision of approved testers, enter test data, but cannot sign a report\n• Tester/Inspector/Process – Supervise trainees, perform testing independently, enter test data but cannot sign a report\n• Signatory – Supervise trainees, perform testing independently, enter test data and sign a report\n• Technical Auditor – Supervise trainees, perform testing, inspection processes independently, enter data, sign a report, and conduct technical audits on other staff\n• Authorised Approver – Authority to supervise other staff, perform testing independently, sign reports, conduct technical audits, approve or revoke approval for trainees, testers, signatories, technical auditors\nFrom this section of the platform an authorised approver can edit the test method, view a history of the test method for the selected user or approve or revoke access.

    "description": "Material grades are used to distinguish different types of material based on their unique properties. The OMS platform allows you to store relevant information regarding material grade. There is no need to add this type of information on numerous occasions, once entered the OMS platform it is stored for future use. When you receive client specific material requirements for a job, the OMS will be able to provide detailed information of the grade of material (if added to the system prior). This information includes: Grade, Description, Engineering Properties, Charpy impact strength, Chemical composition, Other chemical properties. Material identification. Material identification is a systematic approach to identify a particular grade of material. The OMS platform can assist by piecing together the composite of the material and identify the original source. Once this information is entered into the platform, it can be used as a reference point for future use. In this section you can list all specifications this information could be provided by: your client, product or manufacturing standards, acceptance criteria given by your client, or acceptance criteria specified in the standards. Within the rail specifications section, you can also upload documents and store for future use. Documents that can be stored include, client specification or an extract or a commentary on various product or manufacturing standards. Never lose your documents. As OMS is designed to protect data from any loss or inadvertent deletion or any act of sabotage, nothing can be deleted in the OMS. If one of your staff do not need the uploaded document, then they may choose to make that document inactive or archive or discard or stow-away within the OMS. There is no delete button throughout the OMS platform. The OMS platform groups all standards in the one safe, convenient place for a user to access at a time and place that is convenient to them. The OMS platform will list: Standard number, Technique, Description, Module Name, Active Status. The original PDF standard can be attached, and additional information or updates can be made at any time, ensuring the most up to date information is available at any time. Adding a new Process Standard. Adding a new Process standard is easy and can be completed in 6 easy steps. The primary objective in the OMS has always been to provide a complete auditable and traceable LIMS+ERP system with a full suite of productivity tools that can take care of most repetitive tasks by automating those recurring functions. When utilising test procedures on a job, the OMS Platform will provide relevant test procedures depending on the test module. The OMS Platform can pre-fill as much data as possible with a predefined set of information, using intuitive tools to help if the user has any questions/concerns. This will assist to capture accurate and valid data, reducing errors overall, ensuring consistency with data records, and completing the task in timely manner. Some key features include: The OMS platform Search Grid will show all test procedures that exists for the company. Staff can search for a specific test procedure by procedure number, description, active/inactive status. Staff can view, edit, or hide the test procedure. Staff can create new test procedure. The OMS Platform has a ‘Tool-tips’ section to assist staff with relevant procedures. This is the OMS platforms reference library is the key component to any prepopulated dropdown menus available throughout the platform. This was designed to limit the amount of manual data entry that a user is required to input into the system. As an example: If the user is required to enter a coating type for a specific job, the prepopulated dropdown menu will provide: Key: The key information / type, Name and Value: Prepopulated dropdown associated to the Key, Order: the order they will appear in the prepopulated dropdown. Additional items can be added to the reference data at any time. In this section you can list all rail specifications, this information could be provided by: your client, product or manufacturing standards, acceptance criteria given by your client or acceptance criteria specified in the standards. Within the rail specifications section, you can also upload documents and store for future use. Documents that can be stored include, client specification or an extract or a commentary on various product or manufacturing standards. Detailed information is stored in the OMS platform for every test module used in your business. Each module has a list of testing requirements that are either reportable, mandatory, or discretionary. The most competent user will have access to the section and will select what is required to be listed on any test data report. The items selected will appear on any test data report when that module is selected. Client Contact RTC. Detailed information is stored in the OMS platform for every test module used in your business. Each module has a list of testing requirements that are either reportable, mandatory, or discretionary. On occasion a particular client or client contact will need additional testing requirements to be reported. The OMS platform has this covered. You can create a specific client-based module configuration created using the specific requirements from your client contact.",

    "description": "Create a Job: This section is designed to manage process control within a business so that a job can be created only using permitted data input including: Active clients only, Frequently used one of the client’s addresses, Frequently providing one of the client’s staff, Automatic pre-filling of client contact details such as email ID, contact number, any special instructions, Active Specifications such as Product Standards, test-inspection or process Standards, Materials Standards, Prompting user to complete several other mandatory data selection to create a self-explanatory Job sheet. Job confirmation automatic email: The OMS Software platform is designed to operate in accordance with ISO 17025, ISO 17020, ISO 9001 and similar quality Standards where several quality events are required to be completed effectively. ISO 17025 Cl. 7 specifies that the laboratory shall adequately document and understand work requests and contracts. Laboratories shall select appropriate methods and procedures that meet the customers’ requirements and inform them when any deviation from the work request or a contract occurs. The standard also specifies that any differences between the contract or work request shall be resolved before laboratory activities commence. To comply with the above requirements and as a best industry practice, the OMS platform will automatically email job details to the customer after a job has been created in the OMS platform. Automatic email can be configured at each client contact level and ceased at the job creation level or job revision process. In accordance with ISO 17025 Clause 7.1.4, any differences between the work request / contract shall be resolved before laboratory activities commence. Each contract shall be acceptable to both, the laboratory, and the customer. The automated email provides an opportunity to your customer to review the job details and contact you for any discrepancies. This process achieves the ISO requirements and ensures that your business is operating efficiently. Editing a pre-configured email: OMS Software is designed to eliminate as many manual processes as possible, including having pre-configured emails, however we do understand that some elements of a process need to be customisable to allow for client specific information and communication. When emailing a report to a client, the pre-configured email text in the email body, can be modified before sending the email and report to a client. List of Modules: Currently, there are several test, inspection and process modules available in the OMS. Some of them are Intelligence Augmented Automatic Compliance Evaluator (IAACE) modules which use Standards and material properties to evaluate test results to eliminate human errors in interpreting Standards requirements. These modules have been used by laboratories for years witnessing Million+ hours of production testing on actual data by real people (150+ users). NDT modules – VT, MT, PT, ET, UT, UTT, RT and …. Mechanical testing – Tensile*, Impact* and … Weld mechanical testing – VT, Macro, Bend, fracture, transverse tension*, web-flange tension*, impact*, hardness survey* Inspection modules – VI, PVI and … Pressure testing – Hydrostatic test Survey modules – Rail alignment*, Pipe ovality measurement and … Process modules – Welding supervision and … Chemical testing – O.E.S Spectroscopy* (Beta) and … * IAACE – Intelligence Augmented Automatic Compliance Evaluator modules. Structure of modules: The most common excuses for data losses in the industry are tablet broke down, battery drained, internet lost, user forgot to save, and so on. OMS is designed to ensure almost nothing is lost or at the most previous 3 minutes of data loss, in case of a major outage. All modules for test, inspection or process are divided into 8 sections to eliminate or minimise entire data loss. All sections are designed to reduce data entry (typing) by human data and reduce fatigue on the user. JSA Section – Before any onsite job commencement, a user needs to complete Job safety analysis on their smart phone or tablet or smart glasses in the near future. Section 1 – Displays client information for review before commencing a job. No need to enter anything. Section 2 – Displays job related information. Again, nothing to enter except review of job data. Section 3 – User shall enter instrument information. All items are a simple selection of items from the Asset database available within the OMS. Users need to only key in the first 3 letters of the asset number or asset classification and then select from the list. OMS do not display any non-calibrated assets which ensures that the user do not use invalid instruments. Section 4 – The user needs to enter job specific or technique specific information. Most of the information is selection from reference libraries rather than manual typing. All reference libraries are created by Level 3 or competent authorities which your company can modify to suit your needs. Selection of data from reference libraries minimises data entry errors and standardises terminologies used. Section 5 – User needs to type in relevant information because this section contains description, identification of all items and test data. Most fields can be completed by selection of data from the reference libraries but there is still substantial need for data entry by the user. As the user can be on this section for a long time, OMS saves data automatically after every 3 minutes. Section 6 – Designed to manage all photographs and documents which can be stored in the OMS permanently and the user can decide whether to print on a report. Section 7 – Costing and administration section wherein the user needs to enter job related times and cost. Search Jobs: In this section of the OMS platform, a user can easily search and modify any job that is in the system.
